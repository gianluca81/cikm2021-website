# Student Travel Grants

ADCS offers small grants to students (current, prospective, or recently completed) presenting at the conference to help cover the cost of travel and lodging. To be elegible for travel support, students must be authors of full, short or demo papers and presenters of the work at the conference. Application from students that have not authored a contribution in ADCS 2019 will be considered, but will be ranked lowest across among all applicants and may thus be unsuccessful in obtaining support.

In most cases, the travel grant will only cover a portion of the travel expenses. Our goal is to maximize the number of students we can help. If the demand exceeds the available budget, we will prioritize applicants who are full-time students at the time of the conference and those from low-income countries. These grants are given in the form of reimbursement, so students will need to plan to cover their costs upfront.


## Selection Criteria

Applications will be selected according to the following criteria.

### Essential:

 - The student's host university and/or supervisor is unable to fundor fully fund) the travel.
