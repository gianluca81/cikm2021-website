# Registration Scam

We have been made aware that there is a scam involving CIKM 2021 registration.

Some authors have received an email from cikm2021.uq.edu@mail.com with instructions for registrations. Some authors have registered using that system, that is not connected to CIKM 2021. If they registered, they have also been told they won an award, and have been asked to pay additional money. Again, this is not associated to CIKM 2021 and authors of best papers have not been contacted yet (nor are asked to pay extra money).

Please only use the links on the CIKM 2021 website to register (**https://www.cikm2021.org/registration**).

For registration purposes please only send inquiries to **cikm21@uq.edu.au**. You will only receive responses to this address from our Registration Chair (bigk@itee.uq.edu.au) or from the cvent registration system. 

**If you did fall for this scam, please urgently report it to the police in your country.**
