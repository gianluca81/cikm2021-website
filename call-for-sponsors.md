# CIKM 2021 Sponsorship Brief

The 30th ACM International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management ([CIKM 2021](https://www.cikm2021.org/)) provides an international forum for presentation and discussion of research on information and knowledge management, as well as recent advances on data and knowledge bases. The purpose of the conference is to identify challenging problems facing the development of future knowledge and information systems, and to shape future directions of research by soliciting and reviewing high quality, applied and theoretical research findings. An important part of the conference is the Workshops program which focuses on timely research challenges and initiatives. CIKM has a strong tradition of workshops devoted to emerging areas of artificial intelligence, database management, information retrieval, data mining, and related fields.
As a top-tier ACM conference, CIKM attracts the leading researchers and thought leaders from academia and industry.

CIKM offers a unique opportunity to connect with scientists developing next generation techniques, and learn about the state-of-the art and future research directions. In addition, CIKM
offers the chance to meet and recruit the top PhD students. It is an excellent venue to promote your organisation’s brand to thought leaders with global influence. Sponsors will receive extensive exposure to this community during the conference promotion and during the Conference.

We look forward to welcoming you to the virtual conference in 2021 and encourage you to consider the benefits of sponsoring CIKM 2021.
