# Call for Workshop Proposals

The ACM Conference on Information and Knowledge Management (CIKM) is the premier international conference on topics at the confluence of information retrieval, databases, and knowledge management. Running annually since 1992, CIKM attracts top talent from industry and academia, with the goal of fostering collaboration and bridging the academic-commercial gap in the database, information retrieval, and knowledge management communities.

We look for prospective submissions of highly interactive full-/half-day workshops proposing novel research, deepening established research topics or presenting practical applications on the many aspects of the data lifecycle (data acquisition, preprocessing, modeling, integration/aggregation, storage, analysis and consumption). Interdisciplinary workshops bridging across different communities are also highly encouraged.

Workshops will complement the main CIKM conference to be held online and hosted in Gold Coast, Queensland, Australia from November 1-5, 2021
