# Call for Workshop Proposals

The ACM Conference on Information and Knowledge Management (CIKM) is the premier international conference on topics at the confluence of information retrieval, databases, and knowledge management. Running annually since 1992, CIKM attracts top talent from industry and academia, with the goal of fostering collaboration and bridging the academic-commercial gap in the database, information retrieval, and knowledge management communities.

We look for prospective submissions of highly interactive full-/half-day workshops proposing novel research, deepening established research topics or presenting practical applications on the many aspects of the data lifecycle (data acquisition, preprocessing, modeling, integration/aggregation, storage, analysis and consumption). Interdisciplinary workshops bridging across different communities are also highly encouraged.

Workshops will complement the main CIKM conference to be held online and hosted in Gold Coast, Queensland, Australia from November 1-5, 2021

**AUTHORS TAKE NOTE:** The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of your conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work. (For those rare conferences whose proceedings are published in the ACM Digital Library after the conference is over, the official publication date remains the first day of the conference.)

## Submission Guidelines

Please use the [CIKM 2021 Workshop Proposal Template](/dl/CIKM2021-Workshop-Proposal-Template.docx) for your submission.

By default, workshop papers will be included in a CIKM companion volume published by [http://ceur-ws.org/](http://ceur-ws.org/). To help preserve the authors’ ability to submit a revised version of their paper to a conference or journal, joining the volume is left at the discretion of the organizers. Should you decide to go for the companion volume, we might request to align your deadlines to the other interested workshops.
