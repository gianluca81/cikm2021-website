# Call for Short Papers

The Conference on Information and Knowledge Management (CIKM) provides a unique venue for industry and academia to present and discuss state-of-the-art research on artificial intelligence, search and discovery, data mining and database systems, all at a single conference. CIKM is uniquely situated to highlight technologies and insights that materialize the big data and artificial intelligence vision of the future. CIKM 2021 will take place online in a lively and interactive manner.

## Topics of Interest

We encourage submissions of high quality research papers on all topics in the general areas of artificial intelligence, data science, databases, information retrieval, and knowledge management. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to, the following areas:


* Data and information acquisition and preprocessing (e.g., data crawling, IoT data, data quality, data privacy, mitigating biases, data wrangling)

* Integration and aggregation (e.g., semantic processing, data provenance, data linkage, data fusion, knowledge graphs, data warehousing, privacy and security, modeling, information credibility)

* Efficient data processing (e.g., serverless, data-intensive computing, database systems, indexing and compression, architectures, distributed data systems, dataspaces, customized hardware)

* Special data processing (e.g., multilingual text, sequential, stream, spatio-temporal, (knowledge) graph, multimedia, scientific, and social media data)

* Analytics and machine learning (e.g., OLAP, data mining, machine learning and AI, scalable analysis algorithms, algorithmic biases, event detection and tracking, understanding, interpretability)

* Neural Information and knowledge processing (e.g., graph neural networks, domain adaptation, transfer learning, network architectures, neural ranking, neural recommendation, and neural prediction)

* Information access and retrieval (e.g., ad hoc and web search, facets and entities, question answering and dialogue systems, retrieval models, query processing, personalization, recommender and filtering systems)

* Users and interfaces for information and data systems (e.g., user behavior analysis, user interface design, perception of biases, personalization, interactive information retrieval, interactive analysis, spoken interfaces)

* Evaluation, performance studies, and benchmarks (e.g., online and offline evaluation,  best practices)

* Crowdsourcing (e.g. task assignment, worker reliability, optimization, trustworthiness, transparency, best practices)

* Understanding multi-modal content (e.g., natural language processing, speech recognition, computer vision, content understanding, knowledge extraction, knowledge graphs, and knowledge representations)

* Data presentation (e.g., visualization, summarization, readability, VR, speech input/output)

* Applications (e.g., urban systems, biomedical and health informatics, legal informatics, crisis informatics, computational social science, data-enabled discovery, social media)

## Paper Submissions

Authors are invited to submit original short papers that have not been previously published, and are not being considered for publication in any other forum. Short papers should describe ongoing work, recent insights, or summaries of significant research, that address research problems targeting top-tier research venues. Short papers should be particularly well suited to poster presentation.

Manuscripts should be submitted electronically, as PDF formatted using the ACM sigconf template, see [https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template](https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template), with the author names removed to conform with double-blind submission requirements. Papers should be 4 pages in length plus unlimited references. Papers should be submitted through the CIKM 2021 online submission system, choosing the “Short Research Paper Track” option. 

## Dual Submission Policy

It is not allowed to submit papers that are identical (or substantially similar) to versions that have been previously published, or accepted for publication, or that have been submitted in parallel to other conferences. Such submissions violate our dual submission policy. There are several exceptions to this rule:


* Submission is permitted for papers presented or to be presented at conferences or workshops without proceedings, or with only abstracts published.

* Submission is permitted for papers that have previously been made available as a technical report (or similar, e.g., in arXiv). In this case, the authors should not cite the report, so as to preserve anonymity.

## ACM Policy Against Discrimination

All authors and participants must adhere the the ACM discrimination policy. For full details, please visit this site:
