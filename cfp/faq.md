# Submission FAQ

Q: <a href="#faq-0" id="faq-0" class="anchor">When should full papers be submitted?</a>

A: Authors must submit a complete abstract by the abstract deadline (19 May anywhere in the world). All placeholder abstracts will be deleted and authors will not be able to submit a paper.

Q: <a href="#faq-1" id="faq-1" class="anchor">Are we allow to put the draft on Arxiv?</a>

A: ArXiV is not forbidden but understand the risks and you should at least modify the title and abstract to minimize the problems. It is common practice to allow ArXiv in ML but usually papers are there before being published. Submitting them after going into review is sometimes a little dodgy as it is sometimes done to intentionally break blind during the PC bidding process to make it easier to collude.

Q: <a href="#faq-2" id="faq-2" class="anchor">Can papers have an appendix?</a>

A:  Full papers must be 9 pages of content. Papers that include an appendix that exceeds the 9 page content limitation will be desk rejected (we recommend adding the appendix before references to make it clear to reviewers the paper fits within page limits; in the camera-ready, you will be able to move it after the references, but still within the content size limits). Our suggestion is not to have any appendices and put whatever you were going to write there into the relevant section of your paper (this approach is far more likely to be read carefully by reviewers and essential details are far less likely to be missed).

Q: <a href="#faq-3" id="faq-3" class="anchor">Is there a separate abstract submission link?</a>

A: No, please upload the abstract by the abstract deadline, and update your existing submission with your paper by the final submission deadline.

Q: <a href="#faq-4" id="faq-4" class="anchor">What time do submissions close for my deadline?</a>

A: All submission deadlines (abstract deadline, final deadline, etc.) are at **11:59pm** of the respective date.

Q: <a href="#faq-5" id="faq-5" class="anchor">Should the abstract be included in the paper?</a>

A: There was a typo in earlier "author guidance" that mistakenly said abstract instead of appendix. An abstract should be included in the paper.
The sentence in the author guidelines that was sent via email to authors that submitted abstracts to the full paper track should have read:

> Adhere to the 9 content pages + references formatting rule. No appendix is allowed.
