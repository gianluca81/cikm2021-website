# Submission FAQ

Q: [When should full papers be submitted?](#0)

A: Authors must submit a complete abstract by the abstract deadline (19 May anywhere in the world). All placeholder abstracts will be deleted and authors will not be able to submit a paper.

Q: [Are we allow to put the draft on Arxiv?](#1)

A: ArXiV is not forbidden but understand the risks and you should at least modify the title and abstract to minimize the problems. It is common practice to allow ArXiv in ML but usually papers are there before being published. Submitting them after going into review is sometimes a little dodgy as it is sometimes done to intentionally break blind during the PC bidding process to make it easier to collude.

Q: [Can papers have an appendix?](#2)

A: If you choose to have an appendix, it has to be within the page limit. Full papers are 9 pages with as many pages as needed for the bibliography.

Q: [Is there a separate abstract submission link?](#3)

A: No, please upload the abstract by the abstract deadline, and update your existing submission with your paper by the final submission deadline.
