# Call for Tutorials

[https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=cikm2021](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=cikm2021)

The Conference on Information and Knowledge Management (CIKM) provides a unique venue for industry and academia to present and discuss state-of-the-art research on artificial intelligence, search and discovery, data mining and database systems, all at a single conference. CIKM is uniquely situated to highlight technologies and insights on artificial intelligence, search and discovery, data mining and database systems, all at a single conference. CIKM 2021 will take place online in a lively and interactive manner. 

CIKM 2021 will host tutorials covering topics of interest for the CIKM community. Half-day and full-day tutorials that are of interest for the research community will take place before the main conference. 

CIKM 2021 will be a fully virtual conference, with no travel involved. Tutorial presentations will be given through live webinars with synchronized online discussions.

We encourage proposals for both half- and full-day tutorials from active researchers and experienced tutors. Ideally, a tutorial is on a specific topic of interest and will provide a self-contained overview of a topic and then cover the state of the art research and developments on the topic of interest. The general areas include artificial intelligence, data science, databases, information retrieval, knowledge management, and other topics of relevance for the CIKM community. 

CIKM 2021 will provide free registration for at least one tutorial organizer. Please consider the submission guidelines shown below. 

**AUTHORS TAKE NOTE:** The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of your conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work. (For those rare conferences whose proceedings are published in the ACM Digital Library after the conference is over, the official publication date remains the first day of the conference.)

## Submission Guidelines

Each tutorial proposal must include the following information.

 - Title of the tutorial
 - Length (either half-day, i.e., 3 hours plus breaks; or full day, i.e., 6 hours plus breaks)
 - Abstract of up to 150 words
 - Target audience, prerequisites, and benefits. Proposals must clearly identify the intended audience for the tutorial (e.g., novice users of statistical techniques, versus expert researchers in text mining). What background will be required of the audience? Why is this topic important and interesting to the CIKM community? What is the benefit to participants?
 - Outline of the tutorial. Enough material should be included to provide a sense of both the scope of material to be covered and the depth to which it will be covered. The more details that can be provided, the better (up to and including links to the actual slides). Presenters should not focus exclusively on their own research results – a CIKM tutorial is not meant to be a forum for promoting one’s own research or product.
 - A list of the most important references that will be covered in the tutorial.
 - A list of forums, dates, and locations where this or a closely related tutorial has been presented before. Please highlight the similarities and differences between previous related tutorials, and the one proposed for CIKM 2021, using up to 150 words for each.
 - A short bio for each presenter, including their expertise related to the tutorial. Please do not exceed 200 words per presenter.
 - (Optional) URLs of the slides/notes of the previous presentations of this tutorial by the current set of authors.
 - Any specific audio, video, or computer requirements for presenting the tutorial.
 - The length of the whole proposal should be limited to 4 pages in ACM sigconf template, see [https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template](https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template).
 - Please submit your tutorial proposal as a PDF file, choosing the “tutorial track” on the CIKM 2021 online submission system.
