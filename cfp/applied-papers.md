# Call for Applied Papers

[https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=cikm2021](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=cikm2021)

The Conference on Information and Knowledge Management (CIKM) provides a unique venue for industry and academia to present and discuss state-of-the-art research on artificial intelligence, search and discovery, data mining and database systems, all at a single conference. CIKM is uniquely situated to highlight technologies and insights that materialize the big data and artificial intelligence vision of the future. CIKM 2021 will take place online in a lively and interactive manner. 

The Applied Research Track aims at attracting submissions from both industry and academia that either solve or advance the understanding of issues related to deploying AI, IR and big data technologies as part of actual applications.

The Applied Research Track is distinct from the Research Track in that submissions focus on applied work describing e.g. the implementation of a system, the acquisition of data, or the application of a methodology, that solves a significant real-world problem and demonstrates benefits as well as impact. Submissions must clearly describe how their work has been deployed or released, and for how long.

**AUTHORS TAKE NOTE:** The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of your conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work. (For those rare conferences whose proceedings are published in the ACM Digital Library after the conference is over, the official publication date remains the first day of the conference.)


## Key Dates

All deadlines are at 11:59pm in the <a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/time/zones/aoe">Anywhere on Earth</a> timezone.

## Topics of Interest

We encourage submissions  in the same area of relevance as the CIKM2021 Research Track ([cikm2021.org/cfp/full-papers](/cfp/full-papers)), but that describe applied and in-use work, with evidence of a system launch, data release, or other application. The areas of interest include:

* Business Intelligence (e.g., Advertising and E-commerce, Finance, Marketing and Crowds, Recommender systems, Gig Economy)

* Social Networks (e.g., Crowdsourcing, Network sciences, Social media and publishing, Social sciences, User modeling, Web mining)

* Social Good and Fairness (e.g. Fair and Inclusive Systems, Humanitarian Crisis Support, Emergency Detection, Citizen Participation)

* Knowledge Diffusion (e.g. Monitoring Disinformation, Data Journalism, Fact-checking, Bibliometrics)

* Healthcare and Bioinformatics (e.g., Clinical Decision Support, Clinical Research, Healthcare and Caregiving, Patient Empowerment, Genomic applications)

* Computing Infrastructures (e.g., Big Data infrastructures Cloud，Map-Reduce, MPI, Data protection, Design of experiments, Interpretable models, Large-scale optimization, Scalable algorithms)

* Data Quality and its impact on systems (for AI, DBMS, Web, etc.)

* Emerging Applications (e.g., AI in Education, Internet of Things, Cyber Security, Intelligent Transportation)


## Paper Submissions

Authors are invited to submit original applied research results that have not been previously published, are not accepted to be published, and are not currently being considered for publication in any other conference or journal. Submissions do not need to be double-blind, i.e., authors’ names and affiliations can be included in the submission if desired, but they are not required. Manuscripts should be submitted electronically, as PDF files of max 9 pages plus unlimited references, formatted using the ACM camera-ready templates, using the double column template “sig-conf”. Papers should be submitted through the CIKM 2021 online submission system using the “Applied Research Track”. To facilitate review, each paper should provide the topics that it belongs to.

## Dual Submission Policy

It is not allowed to submit papers that are identical (or substantially similar) to versions that have been previously published, or accepted for publication, or that have been submitted in parallel to other conferences. Such submissions violate our dual submission policy. There are several exceptions to this rule:

* Submission is permitted for papers presented or to be presented at conferences or workshops without proceedings, or with only abstracts published.

* Submission is permitted for papers that have previously been made available as a technical report (or similar, e.g., in arXiv). In this case, the authors should not cite the report, so as to preserve anonymity.

## ACM Policy Against Discrimination

All authors and participants must adhere the the ACM discrimination policy.
