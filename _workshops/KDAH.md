Technology disruption through knowledge driven intelligent systems is gradually controlling human life. Management of the knowledge-driven and artificial  intelligence- based technologies is of highest importance to maximize its  progressive influence on human life and human society. For example, social 
network affinity, technology-abuse negatively affect our physical, emotional, social and mental health. Conversely, intelligent systems have the capability to bring  positive impact on human life. This workshop will bring forward those positive  applications and technologies as well as usher the path towards transformation of  intelligent systems that minimize the negative impacts. The intended thrust is to  promote the development of human-centric intelligent technologies like precise and  personalized medication and prognosis prediction, improved elderly care,  minimizing private data theft, knowledge-driven energy and resource  management, deep learning and artificial intelligence-based applications for risk  prediction and augmented human capability generation and related others. This 
workshop aims to bring research outcomes and insights that demonstrate the knowledge-driven technologies, as well as related developments for ensuring  improvement of human quality of life. The impact would be micro-level, where  human life gets impacted in daily basis and at macro-level where human life would  be impacted in long term with its pronounced influence on the betterment to human  society.
