Recently, research in adversarial machine learning has brought to light  important potential security issues with systems that people use on a daily basis for  search and discovery. While adversarial examples are well understood in computer  vision tasks, the harmful effects of the malicious application of machine learning are  less well-understood in information retrieval and recommendation systems. The  issues include: injection of adversarial-crafted fake users, adversarial perturbation of  multimedia data in training sets or background collections, and adversarial structural  noise on graph structure in order to improve search and recommendation in real world environments, research is necessary that will allow us to discover, understand,  and control the adverse impact of adversarial machine learning. In this workshop, we  aim to bring together researchers from the fields of adversarial machine learning,  information retrieval, and recommender systems to discuss recent advances and  research directions that could be further exploited to broaden the frontier in the field.
