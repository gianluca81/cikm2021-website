Web search is one of the most ubiquitous online activities and often used as a starting point to learn, i.e., to acquire or extend one's knowledge about certain topics or procedures. When learning by searching the Web, individuals are confronted with an unprecedented amount of information in various forms and varying quality. Thus, successful learning on the Web requires high degrees of self-regulation and should be supported by the adequate design of search, recommendation, and training tools. This creates a highly interdisciplinary research area at the intersection of information retrieval, human-computer interaction, psychology, and educational sciences. Search as Learning (SAL) research examines the relationships between querying, navigation, media consumption behavior, and the learning outcomes during Web search, how they can be measured, predicted, and supported. 

Building on the growing SAL research community, IWILDS provides an interdisciplinary forum in a full-day workshop that includes keynotes, paper presentations, and discussion. The intended audience consists of researchers and
practitioners from computer science, psychology, information science, and educational science. 

IWILDS’21 specifically invites submissions focussing on challenges caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, investigating, for instance, health-related information acquisition on the Web and the pandemic-induced digitalization of formal learning.
