Of many things, Covid-19 has provided a stark proof that uncertainty is real, and it is  here to stay. Perhaps nothing is more sensitive to uncertainty than the Financial  World. To couple with it, while Artificial Intelligence techniques are used to predict  the future state of events, their performance is significantly impacted by disruptions  not captured in the past. Unforeseen scenarios such as economy changes, variations  in the customer behaviour, pandemics, recessions, and fraudulent transactions often  result in unexpected behaviour of financial models, thus associating a level of  uncertainty with them. It is thus imperative for the research community to explore,  identify, analyze, and address such uncertainties in order to develop robust models  applicable in real-world scenarios. To this effect, the goal of this workshop is to bring  academics and industry experts together to discuss on this important, timely and yet unsolved area of modelling uncertainties in the Financial world.
